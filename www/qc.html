<p>Users should pay close attention to quality control (QC) issues when assembling collections of trait-associated SNPs for PTS calculation.  The PTS scores the GADGET computes are very much dependent upon the quality and accuracy of the input data.  Specific QC issues that users may want to consider include, but may not be limited to:<p>
<ul>
	<li>correct (positive) SNP strand orientation</li>
	<li>SNP strand ambiguity</li>
	<li>low genotyping accuracy for indels</li>
	<li>correct dbSNP build (150)</li>
	<li>linkage disequilibrium (LD)</li>
</ul>
