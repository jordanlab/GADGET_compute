<!-- <h3>PTS calculator for user-supplied SNP sets</h3>
 -->        <ol>
          <li>The Compute utility allows users to compute and visualize global PTS distributions for their own traits of interest.</li><br>
          <li>Users will need a collection of trait-associated SNPs, corresponding their trait of interest, in order to calculate and visualize PTS global distributions.</li><br>
          <li>Users should organize their trait-specific SNP sets in a tab delimited text file (the SNP table) with the following fields:</li>
            <ol type="a">
            <li>SNP – the SNP rsID from dbSNP.</li>
            <li>Effect Allele – the specific allele {A, T, C, or G} that influences the expression of the trait of interest.</li>
            <li>Phenotype – a name or descriptor for the trait (phenotype) of interest.  Note that users can include multiple traits for simultaneous PTS calculation from a single SNP table</li>
            <li>Effect size – the odds ratio (OR) or β-value that measures the magnitude of the effect for that SNP.  If effect sizes are not available, users can leave this position empty, which will default to an unweighted PTS.</li>
            </ol><br>
          <li>An example SNP table is provided.  The example table can be loaded to the server for a test computation, and/or it can be downloaded so that users can visually inspect the required format.</li><br>
          <li>Once the user SNP table is prepared:</li>
          <ol type="a">
              <li>For users with < 1000 trait-associated SNPs:<br> Paste or upload your SNP table in the form shown on the page  To paste click on the upper left cell of the SNP table form and then paste.</li>
              <li>For users with >= 1000 trait-associated SNPs:<br> Upload your SNP table and provide an email to get your results</li>
            </ol>
</ol>

<i>Please note: The interactive calculator only accepts lists of 999 SNPs or fewer.  Larger lists will be subset to the first 999 SNPs</i>
